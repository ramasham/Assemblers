## 📝 What Was Fixed

The issue was an **old Next.js server process** that had been running since 22:34 and was holding port 3000. This prevented the new frontend from starting on the correct port.

**Solution:**
1. Killed old next-server process (PID 59006)
2. Started backend on port 5000
3. Started frontend on port 3000
4. Both services are now running correctly

---

## 🛑 Stop the Application

When you're done, stop both servers:

```bash
pkill -f "node server.js"
pkill -f "next dev"
```

Or use the stop script:
```bash
cd ~/ass
./stop-app.sh
```

---

## 🔄 Restart the Application

If you need to restart later:

```bash
cd ~/ass
./START_EVERYTHING.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd ~/ass/backend && node server.js

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd ~/ass/frontend && npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Open your browser**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Login** with `planner@company.com` / `planner123`
3. **Start using your application!**
