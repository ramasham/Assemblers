## Part 3: Setup Database User

### Step 4: Create Database User (This pops up automatically)

When cluster is ready, a popup will appear:

1. **Security Quickstart** screen appears
2. **Authentication Method:** Keep "Username and Password" selected
3. **Create a database user:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - *(Or click "Autogenerate Secure Password" - but save it!)*
4. Click "Create Database User" button

**Important:** Remember this username and password! You'll need it later.

## Part 4: Setup Network Access

### Step 5: Allow Your IP Address

Still in the popup or next screen:

1. **Where would you like to connect from?**
2. **Choose "Cloud Environment"** or **"My Local Environment"**
3. For testing, click **"Add My Current IP Address"**
4. **Or for easier testing:**
   - Click "Add IP Address" button
   - Select "Allow Access from Anywhere"
   - IP: `0.0.0.0/0`
   - Click "Add Entry"

**Note:** "Allow Access from Anywhere" is for testing only. For production, use specific IPs.

5. Click "Finish and Close" or "Close"

## Part 5: Get Connection String

### Step 6: Get Your MongoDB Connection String

1. **Go to Database** (left sidebar, or click "Database" at top)
2. You'll see your cluster (Cluster0)
3. Click the **"Connect"** button on your cluster
4. Choose **"Drivers"** (Connect your application)
5. **Select:**
   - Driver: **Node.js**
   - Version: **4.1 or later** (or any recent version)
6. **Copy the connection string** - looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

7. **Important:** You'll see `<password>` in the string
   - This is a placeholder!
   - Replace `<password>` with your actual password (e.g., `admin123`)

**Example:**
- ‚ùå Wrong: `mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/`
- ‚úÖ Correct: `mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/`

---

## Part 6: Update Your .env File

### Step 7: Add Connection String to Your Project

1. **Open the backend .env file:**
   ```bash
   nano /home/rama/42/backend/.env
   ```

2. **Find the line with MONGODB_URI**

3. **Replace it with your connection string:**
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/technician-task-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

4. **Add database name:**
   - Add `/technician-task-db` after `.net`
   - Before the `?retryWrites`
   - Like this:
     ```
     mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/technician-task-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

5. **Save the file:**
   - Press `Ctrl + O` (to write/save)
   - Press `Enter` (to confirm)
   - Press `Ctrl + X` (to exit)

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before moving to the next step, make sure:

- ‚úÖ Cluster is created and shows "Active" status
- ‚úÖ Database user created (username: admin, password: admin123)
- ‚úÖ Network access configured (IP address added)
- ‚úÖ Connection string copied
- ‚úÖ `<password>` replaced with actual password
- ‚úÖ `/technician-task-db` added to connection string
- ‚úÖ Connection string pasted in `/home/rama/42/backend/.env`

---

## üéØ Your Final Connection String Should Look Like:

```
mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/technician-task-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**Key parts:**
1. `admin` - your username
2. `admin123` - your password (replace `<password>` with this)
3. `cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net` - your cluster address (yours will be different)
4. `technician-task-db` - database name
5. `?retryWrites=true&w=majority` - connection options

## üîç Finding Things Later

If you close the window and need to find things again:

### Get Connection String Again:
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Click "Database" (left sidebar)
3. Click "Connect" button on your cluster
4. Click "Drivers"
5. Copy the connection string

### Add More IP Addresses:
1. Click "Network Access" (left sidebar)
2. Click "Add IP Address"
3. Add your new IP

### Create More Users:
1. Click "Database Access" (left sidebar)
2. Click "Add New Database User"

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** Double-check:
- Username is correct (`admin`)
- Password is correct (no spaces, correct capitalization)
- You replaced `<password>` with your actual password

### Issue 2: "Connection timeout"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you added your IP address in Network Access
- Or use "Allow Access from Anywhere" (0.0.0.0/0)

### Issue 3: "Database not found"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you added `/technician-task-db` to connection string
- It should be: `.mongodb.net/technician-task-db?retryWrites`

## üì± Alternative: Use Visual Guide

MongoDB Atlas has changed its UI recently. If the steps above don't match exactly:

1. Look for these key actions:
   - **"Create"** or **"Build a Database"** button
   - **"M0 FREE"** tier option
   - **"Connect"** button on your cluster
   - **"Drivers"** option when connecting

2. Follow the on-screen prompts - they guide you through:
   - Creating a user
   - Adding IP address
   - Getting connection string

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

Once you have:
1. ‚úÖ Created cluster
2. ‚úÖ Created user
3. ‚úÖ Added IP address
4. ‚úÖ Updated .env file

**You're ready for Step 2: Start Backend!**

Go back to HOW_TO_RUN.md and continue with Step 2.
