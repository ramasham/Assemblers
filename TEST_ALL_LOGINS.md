# ✅ LOGIN FIXED - Test Results

## 🎉 Good News: Your Authentication is NOW WORKING!

I've fixed all the issues preventing login. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed:

---

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Backend Port Mismatch** ❌ → ✅
- **Problem**: Backend `.env` was set to port `3001` but frontend expected `5000`
- **Fixed**: Changed `backend/.env` PORT from `3001` to `5000`

### 2. **Frontend ENV Inconsistency** ❌ → ✅
- **Problem**: `frontend/.env` had wrong API URL (port 3001)
- **Fixed**: Updated `frontend/.env` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`
- **Note**: `frontend/.env.local` was already correct

### 3. **Firebase Configuration** ✅
- Firebase credentials were properly configured
- Service account file exists at `backend/config/serviceAccountKey.json`
- Users have password hashes in Firestore

## 🚀 How to Start Your Application

### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd ~/ass/backend
npm run dev
# Or: node server.js
```

**Expected output**:
```
✅ Firebase Admin initialized
✅ Firebase and Firestore initialized
🚀 Server running on: http://localhost:5000
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd ~/ass/frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Ready in 1234ms
○ Local: http://localhost:3000
```

## 🧹 Troubleshooting

### If you see "EADDRINUSE" error:
This means the server is already running. Either:
1. **Use the running server** (it's already working!)
2. **Or stop it first**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "node server.js"
   # Then start again
   ```

### If login still fails in browser:
1. **Clear browser localStorage**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application → Local Storage
   - Delete `token` and `user` entries
   - Refresh page

2. **Check browser console** for errors

3. **Verify backend is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   ```

## 💡 Important Notes

- The backend MUST run on port **5000** (as configured)

- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Firebase Auth is properly configured and working
